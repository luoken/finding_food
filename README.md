# FindMeFood

Playing with graphql thing w/ elixir

can do:
  * get all restaurants
  * able to grab by id
  * graph restaurant by selected field (works but needs more work). only works with name atm.

todo:
  * mutations
  * count for items inside


To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000/graphiql`](http://localhost:4000/graphiql) from your browser.
